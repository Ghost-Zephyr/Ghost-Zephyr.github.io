Matrix is in my opinion super cool.
It's a community driven chat system that supports end to end encryption and it's even possible to run it peer to peer if all parties host their own matrix "homeserver".
There are an absolutely insane amount of these "homeservers".

It's recommended you choose one that you trust but any server with the exception of the official matrix.org server should be alright.
The official is always under heavy load and will appear even more sluggish than most servers.
There is also the OpSec point of view where your only option really is to host your own server.

Feel free to join my very own matrix homeserver @ [gay.nigga.no](https://matrix.to/#/#lobby:gay.nigga.no).

One of the many alternatives in [joinmatrix.org's homeserver list](https://joinmatrix.org/servers/) or even one from the bigger [Tatsumo matrix server list](https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/list-of-matrix-servers.html).

And if you're already on the bandwagon, send me a message!~ [@ack:gay.nigga.no](https://matrix.to/#/@ack:gay.nigga.no).
