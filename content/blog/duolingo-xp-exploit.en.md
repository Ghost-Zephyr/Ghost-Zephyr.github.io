It's possible for super/pro users to instantly complete speaking only lessons on iOS.

## How to reproduce

1. Make sure the Duoling app does *not* have microphone access.
2. Start a round of "Perfect Pronunciation" in the "Practice Hub".
3. Click continue and when prompted for microphone access, just click cancel.
4. Profit. (Instant perfect lesson!)

## Summary
The bug here seems to be that the iOS prompt for *possibly* taking the user to the apps permissions in settings, but rather does nothing.
Later we do actually get that iOS prompt on the first lesson.
The Duoling app skips all the speaking lessons as it usually would when denied microphone access.
But this of course is a big problem when all the lessons are speaking lessons.

The end result is an *almost* instant perfect lesson!~
