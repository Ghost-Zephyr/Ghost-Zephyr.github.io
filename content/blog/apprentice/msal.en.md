title: MSAL
description: MSAL the new and cloud/Azure AD only version of the old ADAL, both of these are libraries that Microsoft has implemented in sevral programming languages for Active Directory authenitication built into whatever apps you're programming.

MSAL stands for Microsoft Authentication Library.
It's the replacement for ADAL, the Active Directory Authentication Library.
Although Microsoft now definitely pushes cloud hard like most tech companies.
So MSAL is focused on Azure AD specifically.
Where there is a distinct difference between "organizational" accounts and normal public Microsoft services account.
