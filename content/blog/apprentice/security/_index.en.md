description: Various security issues I found, disclosed and got fixed as an apprentice!
---

Here is a collection of security issues I found, disclosed and got fixed as an apprentice!
This one is divided into two main parts corresponding to the company I worked with when finding the issues.

First one is [Sircon](sircon) and second [SkyLabs](skylabs).
I have a pretty extensive Non Disclosure Agreement with SkyLabs.
So anything I publish to the internet around them needs to be approved or clearly not covered by the NDA.

At SkyLabs I fixed the issues myself, but at Sircon they delegated all the boring support to me and the previous apprentice.
So there I just disclosed the issue to the responsible person and both of them fixed their respective issues within an hour or so of the disclosure.
