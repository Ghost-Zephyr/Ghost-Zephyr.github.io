description: Web Host Manager, this is the secret sauce for many companies that do shared Linux web hosting with cPanel
---

WHM/Web Host Manager is the partner/backend admin panel for [cPanel](../cpanel).
It's made for making shared web hosting super easy.
WHM uses a bunch of server software under the hood for managing DNS, e-mails, web-servers and more.
With WHM, it's super easy managing a whole-bunch of Apache "virtual hosts".
One for each cPanel.

WHM also supports having WHM "partner" accounts out of the box!
This means that the company doing shared hosting with WHM may have partners that also have access to the WHM.
And sells cPanel accounts on the same servers.

You may also change the cPanel branding through WHM.
This is of course for reselling purposes.
