title: My terrible Apprentice experience!
description: Here I'm going to write about my terrible time as an IT apprentice in two different small Norwegian companies. First one does web hosting, second runs Captive Portal services.
---

To be quite frank I had a pretty terrible time as an apprentice.
With problems all the way.
It would've probably gone by fine if I didn't have any sleeping issues.
But that's whatever, cause still both companies I worked at as an apprentice in, in my opinion.
Should've never even been accepted to have apprentices in the first place.
As in Norway the company needs to be registered, with one guy who is supposed to teach stuff to the apprentices.
And another one whom which the apprentices may go to if any issue in the workplace should appear.

All of this was for sure very lacking in both companies.
And it feels like I was just a normal employee that got payed like :poop:.

## Timeline
In chronological order I got approved at Sircon kinda late, after we were done at school and most of the class already working.
And after finding two security issues and being late three times they fired me after only one and a half month.
Two months on paper, but I couldn't do any real IT work after they gave me a notice of the firing.
As they turned off my computer and removed my access to everything while I was given the talk.

After that I just barely got into some alternative thing at school.
That was kinda nice actually, and I probably should've just gone through with it.
Cause then I'd have my papers after only one year.
Whereas a normal apprenticeship in Norway is two years in almost all fields.
This alternative was also pretty fun.
Because my teacher let me work on whatever, as long as it was IT focused and I documented it.

The reason I still went to SkyLabs after all that is mostly money...
Which also happens to seem like the root of my biggest problems at that company...
