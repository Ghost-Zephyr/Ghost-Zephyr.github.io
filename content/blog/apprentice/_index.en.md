title: IT Apprentice
description: This part of my blog is a collection of things I've learned as an apprentice working in IT.
---

This page on my blog serves as an index of technologies I've learned or became better at while working as an apprentice in IT. :grinning:

It also serves the purpose of the required documentation apprentices in Norway are supposed to do. :cowboy: :flushed:

It's mostly in relation to stuff learned at [SkyLabs AS](https://skylabs.no) where we run a captive portal service.
But there is also some stuff from [Sircon AS](https://sircon.no).
Those guys run hosting services, with a focus on cPanel/WordPress shared hosting.
That would be "The WHM saga".
Although when it comes to programming there would be some overlap, but don't dwell on that.
Because at Sircon, I feel like they didn't want me working with code, but rather support only...

Here are lists of stuff I'll be writing about here;
