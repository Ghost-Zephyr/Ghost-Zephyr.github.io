At SkyLabs I fixed the issues myself, but at Sircon they delegated all the boring support to me and the previous apprentice. So there I just disclosed the issue to the responsible person and both of them fixed their respective issues within an hour.
SkyLabs SkyLabs has surprisingly good stability compared to expectations based on the codebase.</description></item><item><title>Matrix, secure and decentralized communications</title><link>https://io.sivert.pw/blog/matrix/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2022 22:00:52 +0000</pubDate><author>gmail@sivert.pw (Sivert V.

It&amp;rsquo;s a community driven chat system that supports end to end encryption and it&amp;rsquo;s even possible to run it peer to peer if all parties host their own matrix &amp;ldquo;homeserver&amp;rdquo;. There are an absolutely insane amount of these &amp;ldquo;homeservers&amp;rdquo;.
It&amp;rsquo;s recommended you choose one that you trust but any server with the exception of the official matrix.org server should be alright. The official is always under heavy load and will appear even more sluggish than most servers.</description></item></channel></rss>
