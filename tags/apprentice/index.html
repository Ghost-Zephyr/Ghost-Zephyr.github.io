Updated 08/08/2022<br>SkyLabs has surprisingly good stability compared to expectations based on the codebase. I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s a byproduct of Python that let&rsquo;s us fail pretty safely on almost all endpoints. The in-house development is mainly four services, two JS frontends and two Python Flask backends, all web.

Updated 08/08/2022<br>Here is a collection of security issues I found, disclosed and got fixed as an apprentice! This one is divided into two main parts corresponding to the company I worked with when finding the issues.
First one is Sircon and second SkyLabs. I have a pretty extensive Non Disclosure Agreement with SkyLabs. So anything I publish to the internet around them needs to be approved or clearly not covered by the NDA.

It also serves the purpose of the required documentation apprentices in Norway are supposed to do. 😳
