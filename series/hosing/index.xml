It&amp;rsquo;s made for making shared web hosting super easy. WHM uses a bunch of server software under the hood for managing DNS, e-mails, web-servers and more. With WHM, it&amp;rsquo;s super easy managing a whole-bunch of Apache &amp;ldquo;virtual hosts&amp;rdquo;. One for each cPanel.
WHM also supports having WHM &amp;ldquo;partner&amp;rdquo; accounts out of the box! This means that the company doing shared hosting with WHM may have partners that also have access to the WHM.</description></item><item><title>cPanel</title><link>https://io.sivert.pw/blog/apprentice/cpanel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2022 14:07:02 +0000</pubDate><author>gmail@sivert.pw (Sivert V.

Although cPanel may run completely on its own, but usually you find its running with WHM. Meaning that whoever sells you the cPanel access sets it up through WHM.
Alone cPanel may be pretty powerful depending on what access you&amp;rsquo;re granted. Often hosting providers will limit you to only access the files of your web-root and settings for additional services like e-mail and DNS.</description></item></channel></rss>
