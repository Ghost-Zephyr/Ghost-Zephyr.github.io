It&amp;rsquo;s possible for super/pro users to instantly complete speaking only lessons on iOS.
How to reproduce Make sure the Duoling app does not have microphone access. Start a round of &amp;ldquo;Perfect Pronunciation&amp;rdquo; in the &amp;ldquo;Practice Hub&amp;rdquo;. Click continue and when prompted for microphone access, just click cancel. Profit. (Instant perfect lesson!) Summary The bug here seems to be that the first in app prompt for microphone access does nothing, except telling the end user to please give up mic perms.</description></item><item><title>Security issues</title><link>https://io.sivert.pw/blog/apprentice/security/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 07:15:51 +0000</pubDate><author>gmail@sivert.pw (Sivert V.

At SkyLabs I fixed the issues myself, but at Sircon they delegated all the boring support to me and the previous apprentice. So there I just disclosed the issue to the responsible person and both of them fixed their respective issues within an hour.
SkyLabs SkyLabs has surprisingly good stability compared to expectations based on the codebase.</description></item></channel></rss>
