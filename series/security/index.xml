At SkyLabs I fixed the issues myself, but at Sircon they delegated all the boring support to me and the previous apprentice. So there I just disclosed the issue to the responsible person and both of them fixed their respective issues within an hour.
SkyLabs SkyLabs has surprisingly good stability compared to expectations based on the codebase.</description></item></channel></rss>
