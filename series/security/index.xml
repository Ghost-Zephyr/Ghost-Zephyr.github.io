What fail2ban simply does is watch log files, match the lines against predefined regex patterns. After a predefined amount of matches for a specific IP, it gets ðŸ”¨ banned. The super cool thing about this is that the max retry, and most options may be set globally, but also locally for each &amp;ldquo;jail&amp;rdquo;. These jails are just configs for the filters.</description></item><item><title>SkyLabs</title><link>https://io.sivert.pw/blog/apprentice/security/skylabs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 13:35:43 +0000</pubDate><author>gmail@sivert.pw (Sivert V.

I&amp;rsquo;m guessing it&amp;rsquo;s a byproduct of Python that let&amp;rsquo;s us fail pretty safely on almost all endpoints. The in-house development is mainly four services, two JS frontends and two Python Flask backends, all web.
These services are a captive portal, it&amp;rsquo;s API and an admin interface web app and it&amp;rsquo;s API.
We support lots of interesting authentication methods!~</description></item><item><title>Sircon</title><link>https://io.sivert.pw/blog/apprentice/security/sircon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 13:12:00 +0000</pubDate><author>gmail@sivert.pw (Sivert V.

Those physical machines run virtual machines that run WHM/cPanel and whatever PHP app the customer would like. But &amp;gt;90% of their customers are non-technical and just only interact with the default WordPress setup and maybe the e-mail service that comes with their cPanel. Most of the people calling in to their support line has problems using their e-mail, and it&amp;rsquo;s usually the end user who fucked up.</description></item><item><title>Security issues</title><link>https://io.sivert.pw/blog/apprentice/security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 13:11:57 +0000</pubDate><author>gmail@sivert.pw (Sivert V.

This one is divided into two main parts corresponding to the company I worked with when finding the issues.
First one is Sircon and second SkyLabs. I have a pretty extensive Non Disclosure Agreement with SkyLabs. So anything I publish to the internet around them needs to be approved or clearly not covered by the NDA.</description></item></channel></rss>
