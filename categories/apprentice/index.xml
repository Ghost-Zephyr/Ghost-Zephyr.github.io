      <description>SkyLabs has surprisingly good stability compared to expectations based on the codebase. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing it&amp;rsquo;s a byproduct of Python that let&amp;rsquo;s us fail pretty safely on almost all endpoints. The in-house development is mainly four services, two JS frontends and two Python Flask backends, all web.
These services are a captive portal, it&amp;rsquo;s API and an admin interface web app and it&amp;rsquo;s API.
We support lots of interesting authentication methods!~</description>

      <description>These guys have a few beefy ass physical servers in their own rack in a supposedly EMP and fire safe room in the basement of their offices. Those physical machines run virtual machines that run WHM/cPanel and whatever PHP app the customer would like. But &amp;gt;90% of their customers are non-technical and just only interact with the default WordPress setup and maybe the e-mail service that comes with their cPanel. Most of the people calling in to their support line has problems using their e-mail, and it&amp;rsquo;s usually the end user who fucked up.</description>

      <description>Here is a collection of security issues I found, disclosed and got fixed as an apprentice! This one is divided into two main parts corresponding to the company I worked with when finding the issues.
First one is Sircon and second SkyLabs. I have a pretty extensive Non Disclosure Agreement with SkyLabs. So anything I publish to the internet around them needs to be approved or clearly not covered by the NDA.</description>

      <description>This page on my blog serves as an index of technologies I&amp;rsquo;ve learned or became better at while working as an apprentice in IT. ðŸ˜€
It also serves the purpose of the required documentation apprentices in Norway are supposed to do. ðŸ¤  ðŸ˜³
It&amp;rsquo;s mostly in relation to stuff learned at SkyLabs AS where we run a captive portal service. But there is also some stuff from Sircon AS. Those guys run hosting services, with a focus on cPanel/WordPress shared hosting.</description>
