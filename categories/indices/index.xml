It also serves the purpose of the required documentation apprentices in Norway are supposed to do. ðŸ¤  ðŸ˜³
It&amp;rsquo;s mostly in relation to stuff learned at SkyLabs AS where we run a captive portal service. But there is also some stuff from Sircon AS. Those guys run hosting services, with a focus on cPanel/WordPress shared hosting.</description></item></channel></rss>
