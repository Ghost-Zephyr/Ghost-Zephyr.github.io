This one is divided into two main parts corresponding to the company I worked with when finding the issues.</p><p>First one is <a href=sircon target=_blank>Sircon</a> and second <a href=skylabs target=_blank>SkyLabs</a>.
I have a pretty extensive Non Disclosure Agreement with SkyLabs.
So anything I publish to the internet around them needs to be approved or clearly not covered by the NDA.</p><p>At SkyLabs I fixed the issues myself, but at Sircon they delegated all the boring support to me and the previous apprentice.
So there I just disclosed the issue to the responsible person and both of them fixed their respective issues within an hour or so of the disclosure.</p><br><h3>Posts</h3><ul class=contents><br><a href=/blog/apprentice/security/skylabs/><li><article><div><h3>SkyLabs</h3>Published 04/07/2022

These services are a captive portal, it&rsquo;s API and an admin interface web app and it&rsquo;s API.
We support lots of interesting authentication methods!~

Updated 08/08/2022<br>These guys have a few beefy ass physical servers in their own rack in a supposedly EMP and fire safe room in the basement of their offices. Those physical machines run virtual machines that run WHM/cPanel and whatever PHP app the customer would like. But >90% of their customers are non-technical and just only interact with the default WordPress setup and maybe the e-mail service that comes with their cPanel. Most of the people calling in to their support line has problems using their e-mail, and it&rsquo;s usually the end user who fucked up.
