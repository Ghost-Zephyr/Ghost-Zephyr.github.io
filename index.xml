It&amp;rsquo;s possible for super/pro users to instantly complete speaking only lessons on iOS.
How to reproduce Make sure the Duoling app does not have microphone access. Start a round of &amp;ldquo;Perfect Pronunciation&amp;rdquo; in the &amp;ldquo;Practice Hub&amp;rdquo;. Click continue and when prompted for microphone access, just click cancel. Profit. (Instant perfect lesson!) Summary The bug here seems to be that the first in app prompt for microphone access does nothing, except telling the end user to please give up mic perms.</description></item><item><title>Security issues</title><link>https://io.sivert.pw/blog/apprentice/security/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 07:15:51 +0000</pubDate><author>gmail@sivert.pw (Sivert V.

At SkyLabs I fixed the issues myself, but at Sircon they delegated all the boring support to me and the previous apprentice. So there I just disclosed the issue to the responsible person and both of them fixed their respective issues within an hour.
SkyLabs SkyLabs has surprisingly good stability compared to expectations based on the codebase.</description></item><item><title>Azure App Registration</title><link>https://io.sivert.pw/blog/apprentice/azure-app-registration/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2022 15:05:05 +0000</pubDate><author>gmail@sivert.pw (Sivert V. SÃ¦ther)</author><guid>https://io.sivert.pw/blog/apprentice/azure-app-registration/</guid><description>You can find the App Registrations in Azure under Azure AD or directly by search. Once there you can click the &amp;ldquo;New registration&amp;rdquo; button on the top left. Then you&amp;rsquo;ll need to fill in name, account types and optionally a redirect URI.
The Azure App Registration page The first thing to do now is &amp;ldquo;Branding &amp;amp; properties&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; haha. The app authenticates towards Microsoft with either a certificate or app secrets. So the actual first thing to do is to go over the &amp;ldquo;Authentication&amp;rdquo; tab, just check that all looks good.</description></item><item><title>Handlebars.js</title><link>https://io.sivert.pw/blog/apprentice/handlebars/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 09:14:23 +0000</pubDate><author>gmail@sivert.pw (Sivert V. SÃ¦ther)</author><guid>https://io.sivert.pw/blog/apprentice/handlebars/</guid><description>Handlebars.js is a templating engine like jinja2, but entirely in JavaScript.
Personally I&amp;rsquo;ve only found pug templates very nice to work with as I love the minimal syntax.
What makes handlebars cool is it&amp;rsquo;s ability to render templates both server and client side, if you&amp;rsquo;re running node.js on the server.
Running it in the frontend is super easy, check this example from the handlebars docs;

SÃ¦ther)</author><guid>https://io.sivert.pw/blog/matrix/</guid><description>Matrix is in my opinion super cool. It&amp;rsquo;s a community driven chat system that supports end to end encryption and it&amp;rsquo;s even possible to run it peer to peer if all parties host their own matrix &amp;ldquo;homeserver&amp;rdquo;. There are an absolutely insane amount of these &amp;ldquo;homeservers&amp;rdquo;.
It&amp;rsquo;s recommended you choose one that you trust but any server with the exception of the official matrix.org server should be alright. The official is always under heavy load and will appear even more sluggish than most servers.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://io.sivert.pw/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Mar 2022 18:08:24 +0000</pubDate><author>gmail@sivert.pw (Sivert V.
